This is a simple script that gives Instagram an 'overhaul', i call it InstaHaul! 


# Features


This script adds dark mode to Instagram, volume & video controls, and a progress bar on videos (Reels). That's it, pretty simple, but works well! 


The theme is an __official__ Instagram site. Type in __https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en&theme=dark__, and you'll see that __'@theme=dark'__ makes Instagram web browser into dark mode, that's it, the script simply adds that to the search bar. 


For the video enhances, it has memory for what volume you prefer and sets the videos to that volume. It auto-plays videos (reels), by removing the play button, loops videos, and adds native video controls. An addition of a progress bar! 


Currently, the progress bar is purple, with an inverted background depending on the video playing. To change the colour, go into the line __'ProgressbarElapsedColor = "#7c3aed"; and change that #7c3aed to a different HEX code colour. Some examples would be pink #FFC0CB, or red #FF001F, you can do light blue #94a3b8, any colour you can think of you can do, just use hex format!__
