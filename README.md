# What will happen now:
As of now, I am planning on either adding more to the progress bar, and removing the dark-mode toggle as Instagram website now supports dark mode, making this redundant, I might add more currently I've been working on SpotOn A LOT, so, this will either move to a Chromme extension method, be archived or I'll add more features. Currently, I am focusing on SpotOn, as that is my main source of enjoyment per se. 

Remember any issues feel free to talk about it, or make an issue form.

This is a simple script that gives Instagram an 'overhaul', i call it InstaHaul! 


# Features


This script adds dark mode to Instagram, volume & video controls, and a progress bar on videos (Reels). That's it, pretty simple, but works well! 


The theme is an __official__ Instagram site. Type in __https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en&theme=dark__, and you'll see that __'@theme=dark'__ makes Instagram web browser into dark mode, that's it, the script simply adds that to the search bar. 


For the video enhances, it has memory for what volume you prefer and sets the videos to that volume. It auto-plays videos (reels), by removing the play button, loops videos, and adds native video controls. An addition of a progress bar! 


Currently, the progress bar is purple, with an inverted background depending on the video playing. To change the colour, go into the line __'ProgressbarElapsedColor = "#7c3aed"; and change that #7c3aed to a different HEX code colour. Some examples would be pink #FFC0CB, or red #FF001F, you can do light blue #94a3b8, any colour you can think of you can do, just use hex format!__
